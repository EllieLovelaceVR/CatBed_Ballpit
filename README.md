## Special Thanks

 * D4rkPl4y3r for the idea, and several pointers!  Also, the binning principle.
 * ERROR.mdl for the `SV_DepthLessEqual` trick to make unsorted high performance balls.
 * TCL for the multiple render texture trick + the explicit camera order trick.
 * Everyone on the VRC Shader Discord for the 50+ questions I had to ask to write this.
